# LJ Code 201 - Day 11 and Day 12

Monday learning journal.  Had a whole new exercise today to start building the
bus mall catalog.  Seems pretty straight forward to this point.  Was able to knock out the
requirements pretty easily.

Tuesday Learning journal.  I am just gonna submit the two of these journals to both of
the learning journal entries because they are both due on wednesday and I am not sure
what the deal is.  Worked on charts.js today and that seemed pretty straight forward as well.
Spent a good chunk of time today trying to help others figure out the process for
this assignment.  All in all, I think I am getting way better at helping others
as well as figuring how to approach reading other people's code.  Until tomorrow!
