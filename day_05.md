# LJ Code 201 - Day 5

Day five was a good day.  Following specific instructions to code some functions
is always a fun exercise.  Spent some time trying to explain my logic to my fellow
classmates only to have a TA come by and tell them that it was wrong.  Not sure
it is wrong, but more likely not as efficient as it could be. Regardless, practice
practice practice.  Week one is history and I am looking forward to week two.
