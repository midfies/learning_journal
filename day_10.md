# LJ Code 201 - Day 10

Excedllent exercise today. I really liked doing the wireframing exercise. I learned a lot
from this and I think this should have been used earlier on in the course
in order to better help me understand the priciples of CSS.  Assignments like
these could be used to strengthen the understanding of the position and display attributes.
