# LJ Code 201 - Day 13
Lots of fun for pair programming today.  Was able to work with ken. I learned a
whole lot going through the troubleshooting process on someone else's code.
We were able to get both his and my code to where we needed to be for the day
and that feels pretty dang good.  Still need to add some CSS to this bus mall
project but I can do that at a later time. Keep on driving on!
