# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Today was another good exercise in javascript.  I was able to accomplish the task
in an hour or so and spent the rest of the lab time trying to mess with the CSS
for the front facing index page.  I still feel like I am struggling to develop and
implement a well designed web page.  While I have little problems doing the math
and logic of programming, I don't feel like I have the artistic wherewithal to
put together a web page.  Practice, practice, practice and we will grow!!
