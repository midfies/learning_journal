# LJ Code 201 - Day 1
Today was the first day of my code fellows experience and so far everything seems to be going just fine.
I have noticed that due to my computer science degree I have a head start on a lot of the people in this class.
That will be useful for me when it gives me the opportunity to help out other classmates.

The majority of the topics covered in class today were basically review for me except for quick short cuts and whatnot.
I am excited to actually get some training on Git and GitHub because I used these in school but was never formally trained.

Day one in the books! Looking forward to tomorrow!
