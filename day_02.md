# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Day two is in the books here at code fellows 201.  Today we started to get more
in depth with JS and CSS. Not a whole lot of new material for me during the classroom
lecture but it was a good review.

As for the lab, creating the guessing game was quite simple, I would like to
be able to edit the prompt and alert boxes in order to customize the game a little
more but its really not that important.  The CSS on the about me page was a little
frustrating as most people who work with CSS know.  One little missing bracket and
I spend 15 minutes trying to fix something that really isn't broke.

Anyways, that is programming at its finest.  Continue to learn and grow.

And here I attempt to add a image to the file using markdown...
