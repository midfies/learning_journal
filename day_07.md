# LJ Code 201 - Day 7

Was able to knock out the constructor function pretty quickly. Literal notation
makes it simple to do so.  I did have a little bit of problems trying to get the
tables to show up properly on the cookie stand page.  I think the biggest issue there
was figuring out the logic of splitting that functionality between the render
function in the constructor and the header and footer functions that sat outside of it.
Once I figured that out it was pretty smooth.  Going to spend the rest of the day
working on the base of my learning pyramid and help by teaching others.  Another
good day!
