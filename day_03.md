# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Today was much more challenging than the first two days.  This is most likely
because there was a lot more to do today than in the last few days.

I also spent some time during lab today helping some other people who were having
a hard time even starting and that is something I hope to get better at as
time goes on.  I need to focus on the vocabulary of programming as its a
constant hole I keep falling into.  While i may understand things in my
mind's eye it does me no good if I can't share that knowledge.\

Still improving on my CSS but hopefully tomorrow our class will give me a better
warm and fuzzy here.  I also added a few more blocks of information on my
about me page.  I love it when a plan comes together.

Do GIFs work on markup as well?  Let's see!
